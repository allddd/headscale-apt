Description: Open source implementation of the Tailscale control server.
 Headscale aims to implement a self-hosted, open source alternative to the
 Tailscale control server. Headscale's goal is to provide self-hosters and
 hobbyists with an open-source server they can use for their projects and
 labs. It implements a narrow scope, a single Tailscale network (tailnet),
 suitable for a personal use, or a small open-source organisation.
